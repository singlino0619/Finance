    "\\sum_{i = 1}^{3}  L(t_{i-1}, t_{i}) \\times DF(t_{i}) \\times \\delta = \\sum_{i = 1}^{3} SwapRate(1.5Y) \\times DF(t_{i})\\times \\delta\n",

    "$$\n",
    "The above equation can be solved by using $DF(t_{0.5Y})$, $DF(t_{1.0Y})$ and the floot interest rate which is defined as above equation. As a result, the discount factor $DF(t_{1.5Y})$  is given by\n",

    "where $DF(t_{0.5Y})$ and $DF(t_{1.0Y})$ is calculated by using a quoted LIBOR (the rate of Money Market). The short rate of Money Market means spot rate, where the cashflows is expressed as only two terms. For example, $DF(t_{0.5Y})$ is given by\n",
